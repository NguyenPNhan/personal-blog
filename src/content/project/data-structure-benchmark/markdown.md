title: Data Structure Benchmark in C++
date: 2026-07-11
excerpt: This project implements several data structures behind one set-like interface and compares their running time for insertion, removal, and search workloads.

---
Every structure implements `DataStructure` in `data_structure.h`:

```cpp
virtual void insert(int value) = 0;
virtual void remove(int value) = 0;
virtual bool search(int value) const = 0;
```

The benchmark uses unique positive integers from `1` to `N`. It is intended as an educational comparison of these implementations, not as a replacement for production containers or a statistically rigorous benchmark suite.

## Implemented data structures

| Data structure | Header | Expected operation cost |
|---|---|---|
| Adelson-Velsky-Landis (AVL) tree | `adelson_velsky_landis_tree.h` | `O(log N)` insert, remove, and search |
| Binary heap | `binary_heap.h` | `O(N)` for this interface because duplicate checks, arbitrary removal, and search scan the heap |
| Binary search tree | `binary_search_tree.h` | Average `O(log N)`, worst-case `O(N)` |
| Binary search trie | `binary_search_trie.h` | `O(W)`, where `W` is the fixed integer bit width |
| Cuckoo hash table | `cuckoo_hash_table.h` | Average `O(1)`; insertion may trigger a rebuild |
| Hash table with separate chaining | `hash_table.h` | Average `O(1)`, worst-case `O(N)` |
| Linked list | `linked_list.h` | `O(N)` insert, remove, and search |
| Red-black tree | `red_black_tree.h` | `O(log N)` insert, remove, and search |
| Sorted array | `sorted_array.h` | `O(N)` insert/remove and `O(log N)` search |
| Splay tree | `splay_tree.h` | Amortized `O(log N)`, worst-case `O(N)` per operation |
| Treap | `treap.h` | Expected `O(log N)`, worst-case `O(N)` |

## Benchmark methodology

The shared harness is in `benchmark/benchmark_common.h`. Each structure is tested at `1,000`, `10,000`, `20,000`, `50,000`, `100,000`, and `200,000` elements.

The workloads are:

- **Random:** insert a deterministic random permutation of `1..N`.
- **Increasing:** insert `1..N` in sorted order.
- **Small shuffle:** start with increasing values and shuffle values at 10% of the positions.
- **Remove:** build from a random permutation, then remove all values in a different random order.
- **Search all:** insert and search all `N` values; every search is a hit.
- **Small search, large insert:** insert `N` values and search for `N / 10` present values.
- **Large search, small insert:** insert `N / 10` values, then search `N` values; `N / 10` searches are hits.

Input generation, structure setup for remove/search tests, and correctness validation are outside the timed regions. Only the operation loop is measured with `std::chrono::steady_clock`. Random inputs use fixed seeds, so the ordering is reproducible for a given size.

## Recorded results

The following table summarizes the recorded results at `N = 200,000`. Times are milliseconds; lower is better. The fastest recorded time in each column is bold.
